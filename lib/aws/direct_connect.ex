defmodule AWS.DirectConnect do
  @moduledoc """
  AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network
  connection from your premises to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using AWS
  Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your
  data center, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can
  reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a
  more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.

  The AWS Direct Connect API Reference provides descriptions, syntax, and
  usage examples for each of the actions and data types for AWS Direct
  Connect. Use the following links to get started using the *AWS Direct
  Connect API Reference*:

  Creates a new interconnect between a AWS Direct Connect partner's network

  An interconnect is a connection which is capable of hosting other

  have their own connections. Like a standard connection, an interconnect
  links the AWS Direct Connect partner's network to an AWS Direct Connect
  location over a standard 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One
  end is connected to the partner's router, the other to an AWS Direct
  Connect router.

  For each end customer, the AWS Direct Connect partner provisions a
  connection on their interconnect by calling
  AllocateConnectionOnInterconnect. The end customer can then connect to AWS
  resources by creating a virtual interface on their connection, using the
