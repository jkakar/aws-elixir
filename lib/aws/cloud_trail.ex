  AWS CloudTrail

  This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions,
  data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail.

  CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account
  and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information
  includes the identity of the user, the start time of the AWS API call, the
  source IP address, the request parameters, and the response elements
  returned by the service.

  <note> As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs,
  which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
  languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs
  provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWSCloudTrail.
  For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests,
  managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about
  the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the [Tools
  for Amazon Web Services page](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/). </note> See
  the CloudTrail User Guide for information about the data that is included
  with each AWS API call listed in the log files.

  Adds one or more tags to a trail, up to a limit of 10. Tags must be unique

  for an existing tag key. If you specify a key without a value, the tag will
  be created with the specified key and a value of null. You can tag a trail
  that applies to all regions only from the region in which the trail was

  Looks up API activity events captured by CloudTrail that create, update, or

  (defined by a start time and end time), user name, event name, resource
  type, and resource name. All attributes are optional. The maximum number of
  attributes that can be specified in any one lookup request are time range
  and one other attribute. The default number of results returned is 10, with
  a maximum of 50 possible. The response includes a token that you can use to
  get the next page of results.
