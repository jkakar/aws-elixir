  Creates a Amazon Kinesis stream. A stream captures and transports data
  records that are continuously emitted from different data sources or
  *producers*. Scale-out within an Amazon Kinesis stream is explicitly
  supported by means of shards, which are uniquely identified groups of data
  records in an Amazon Kinesis stream.

  You specify and control the number of shards that a stream is composed of.
  Each shard can support reads up to 5 transactions per second, up to a
  maximum data read total of 2 MB per second. Each shard can support writes
  up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MB
  per second. You can add shards to a stream if the amount of data input
  increases and you can remove shards if the amount of data input decreases.

  The stream name identifies the stream. The name is scoped to the AWS
  account used by the application. It is also scoped by region. That is, two
  streams in two different accounts can have the same name, and two streams
  in the same account, but in two different regions, can have the same name.

  `CreateStream` is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a
  `CreateStream` request, Amazon Kinesis immediately returns and sets the
  stream status to `CREATING`. After the stream is created, Amazon Kinesis
  sets the stream status to `ACTIVE`. You should perform read and write
  operations only on an `ACTIVE` stream.

  You receive a `LimitExceededException` when making a `CreateStream` request
  if you try to do one of the following:

  <ul> <li>Have more than five streams in the `CREATING` state at any point
  in time.</li> <li>Create more shards than are authorized for your
  account.</li> </ul> For the default shard limit for an AWS account, see

  Deletes a stream and all its shards and data. You must shut down any

  If an application attempts to operate on a deleted stream, it will receive

  If the stream is in the `ACTIVE` state, you can delete it. After a
  `DeleteStream` request, the specified stream is in the `DELETING` state
  until Amazon Kinesis completes the deletion.

  **Note:** Amazon Kinesis might continue to accept data read and write
  operations, such as `PutRecord`, `PutRecords`, and `GetRecords`, on a
  stream in the `DELETING` state until the stream deletion is complete.

  When you delete a stream, any shards in that stream are also deleted, and
  any tags are dissociated from the stream.

  stream, which is returned in `StreamStatus`.

  Describes the specified stream.

  The information about the stream includes its current status, its Amazon
  Resource Name (ARN), and an array of shard objects. For each shard object,
  there is information about the hash key and sequence number ranges that the
  shard spans, and the IDs of any earlier shards that played in a role in
  creating the shard. A sequence number is the identifier associated with
  every record ingested in the Amazon Kinesis stream. The sequence number is
  assigned when a record is put into the stream.

  You can limit the number of returned shards using the `Limit` parameter.
  The number of shards in a stream may be too large to return from a single
  call to `DescribeStream`. You can detect this by using the `HasMoreShards`
  flag in the returned output. `HasMoreShards` is set to `true` when there is
  more data available.

  `DescribeStream` is a paginated operation. If there are more shards
  available, you can request them using the shard ID of the last shard
  returned. Specify this ID in the `ExclusiveStartShardId` parameter in a
  subsequent request to `DescribeStream`.

  Gets data records from a shard.

  Specify a shard iterator using the `ShardIterator` parameter. The shard
  iterator specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start
  reading data records sequentially. If there are no records available in the
  portion of the shard that the iterator points to, `GetRecords` returns an
  empty list. Note that it might take multiple calls to get to a portion of
  the shard that contains records.

  You can scale by provisioning multiple shards. Your application should have
  one thread per shard, each reading continuously from its stream. To read
  from a stream continually, call `GetRecords` in a loop. Use
  `GetShardIterator` to get the shard iterator to specify in the first
  `GetRecords` call. `GetRecords` returns a new shard iterator in
  `NextShardIterator`. Specify the shard iterator returned in
  `NextShardIterator` in subsequent calls to `GetRecords`. Note that if the
  shard has been closed, the shard iterator can't return more data and
  `GetRecords` returns `null` in `NextShardIterator`. You can terminate the
  loop when the shard is closed, or when the shard iterator reaches the
  record with the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the
  last record to process.

  Each data record can be up to 1 MB in size, and each shard can read up to 2
  MB per second. You can ensure that your calls don't exceed the maximum
  supported size or throughput by using the `Limit` parameter to specify the
  maximum number of records that `GetRecords` can return. Consider your
  average record size when determining this limit.

  The size of the data returned by `GetRecords` will vary depending on the
  utilization of the shard. The maximum size of data that `GetRecords` can
  return is 10 MB. If a call returns this amount of data, subsequent calls
  made within the next 5 seconds throw
  `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`. If there is insufficient
  provisioned throughput on the shard, subsequent calls made within the next
  1 second throw `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`. Note that
  `GetRecords` won't return any data when it throws an exception. For this
  reason, we recommend that you wait one second between calls to
  `GetRecords`; however, it's possible that the application will get
  exceptions for longer than 1 second.

  To detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you can
  use the `MillisBehindLatest` response attribute. You can also monitor the
  stream using CloudWatch metrics (see [Monitoring Amazon
  Kinesis](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/monitoring.html) in
  the *Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide*).

  Each Amazon Kinesis record includes a value, `ApproximateArrivalTimestamp`,
  that is set when an Amazon Kinesis stream successfully receives and stores
  a record. This is commonly referred to as a server-side timestamp, which is
  different than a client-side timestamp, where the timestamp is set when a
  data producer creates or sends the record to a stream. The timestamp has
  millisecond precision. There are no guarantees about the timestamp
  accuracy, or that the timestamp is always increasing. For example, records
  in a shard or across a stream might have timestamps that are out of order.

  Gets a shard iterator. A shard iterator expires five minutes after it is
  returned to the requester.

  A shard iterator specifies the position in the shard from which to start
  reading data records sequentially. A shard iterator specifies this position
  using the sequence number of a data record in a shard. A sequence number is
  the identifier associated with every record ingested in the Amazon Kinesis
  stream. The sequence number is assigned when a record is put into the
  stream.

  You must specify the shard iterator type. For example, you can set the
  `ShardIteratorType` parameter to read exactly from the position denoted by
  a specific sequence number by using the `AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` shard iterator
  type, or right after the sequence number by using the
  `AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` shard iterator type, using sequence numbers
  returned by earlier calls to `PutRecord`, `PutRecords`, `GetRecords`, or
  `DescribeStream`. You can specify the shard iterator type `TRIM_HORIZON` in
  the request to cause `ShardIterator` to point to the last untrimmed record
  in the shard in the system, which is the oldest data record in the shard.
  Or you can point to just after the most recent record in the shard, by
  using the shard iterator type `LATEST`, so that you always read the most
  recent data in the shard.

  When you repeatedly read from an Amazon Kinesis stream use a
  `GetShardIterator` request to get the first shard iterator for use in your
  first `GetRecords` request and then use the shard iterator returned by the
  `GetRecords` request in `NextShardIterator` for subsequent reads. A new
  shard iterator is returned by every `GetRecords` request in
  `NextShardIterator`, which you use in the `ShardIterator` parameter of the
  next `GetRecords` request.

  If a `GetShardIterator` request is made too often, you receive a
  `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`. For more information about
  throughput limits, see `GetRecords`.

  If the shard is closed, the iterator can't return more data, and
  `GetShardIterator` returns `null` for its `ShardIterator`. A shard can be
  closed using `SplitShard` or `MergeShards`.

  `GetShardIterator` has a limit of 5 transactions per second per account per

  increase the time period records are accessible that have not yet expired.
  However, it will not make previous data that has expired (older than the

  Merges two adjacent shards in a stream and combines them into a single
  shard to reduce the stream's capacity to ingest and transport data. Two
  shards are considered adjacent if the union of the hash key ranges for the
  two shards form a contiguous set with no gaps. For example, if you have two
  shards, one with a hash key range of 276...381 and the other with a hash
  key range of 382...454, then you could merge these two shards into a single
  shard that would have a hash key range of 276...454. After the merge, the
  single child shard receives data for all hash key values covered by the two
  parent shards.

  `MergeShards` is called when there is a need to reduce the overall capacity
  of a stream because of excess capacity that is not being used. You must
  specify the shard to be merged and the adjacent shard for a stream. For
  more information about merging shards, see [Merge Two
  Shards](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-resharding-merge.html)

  Writes a single data record from a producer into an Amazon Kinesis stream.
  Call `PutRecord` to send data from the producer into the Amazon Kinesis
  stream for real-time ingestion and subsequent processing, one record at a
  time. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a
  maximum data write total of 1 MB per second.

  You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and
  transports the data; a partition key; and the data blob itself.

  The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log
  file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so on.

  The partition key is used by Amazon Kinesis to distribute data across
  shards. Amazon Kinesis segregates the data records that belong to a data
  stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each
  data record to determine which shard a given data record belongs to.

  Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256
  characters for each key. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys
  to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards
  using the hash key ranges of the shards. You can override hashing the
  partition key to determine the shard by explicitly specifying a hash value
  using the `ExplicitHashKey` parameter. For more information, see [Adding
  Data to a
  Stream](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream)
  in the *Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide*.

  `PutRecord` returns the shard ID of where the data record was placed and
  the sequence number that was assigned to the data record.

  Sequence numbers generally increase over time. To guarantee strictly
  increasing ordering, use the `SequenceNumberForOrdering` parameter. For
  more information, see [Adding Data to a
  Stream](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream)
  in the *Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide*.

  If a `PutRecord` request cannot be processed because of insufficient
  provisioned throughput on the shard involved in the request, `PutRecord`
  throws `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`.

  Writes multiple data records from a producer into an Amazon Kinesis stream
  in a single call (also referred to as a `PutRecords` request). Use this
  operation to send data from a data producer into the Amazon Kinesis stream
  for data ingestion and processing.

  Each `PutRecords` request can support up to 500 records. Each record in the
  request can be as large as 1 MB, up to a limit of 5 MB for the entire
  request, including partition keys. Each shard can support writes up to
  1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MB per
  second.

  You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and
  transports the data; and an array of request `Records`, with each record in
  the array requiring a partition key and data blob. The record size limit
  applies to the total size of the partition key and data blob.

  The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log
  file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so on.

  The partition key is used by Amazon Kinesis as input to a hash function
  that maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. An MD5
  hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and
  to map associated data records to shards. As a result of this hashing
  mechanism, all data records with the same partition key map to the same
  shard within the stream. For more information, see [Adding Data to a
  Stream](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream)
  in the *Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide*.

  Each record in the `Records` array may include an optional parameter,
  `ExplicitHashKey`, which overrides the partition key to shard mapping. This
  parameter allows a data producer to determine explicitly the shard where
  the record is stored. For more information, see [Adding Multiple Records
  with
  PutRecords](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords)
  in the *Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide*.

  The `PutRecords` response includes an array of response `Records`. Each
  record in the response array directly correlates with a record in the
  request array using natural ordering, from the top to the bottom of the
  request and response. The response `Records` array always includes the same
  number of records as the request array.

  The response `Records` array includes both successfully and unsuccessfully
  processed records. Amazon Kinesis attempts to process all records in each
  `PutRecords` request. A single record failure does not stop the processing
  of subsequent records.

  A successfully-processed record includes `ShardId` and `SequenceNumber`
  values. The `ShardId` parameter identifies the shard in the stream where
  the record is stored. The `SequenceNumber` parameter is an identifier
  assigned to the put record, unique to all records in the stream.

  An unsuccessfully-processed record includes `ErrorCode` and `ErrorMessage`
  values. `ErrorCode` reflects the type of error and can be one of the
  following values: `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` or
  `InternalFailure`. `ErrorMessage` provides more detailed information about
  the `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` exception including the
  account ID, stream name, and shard ID of the record that was throttled. For
  more information about partially successful responses, see [Adding Multiple
  Records with
  PutRecords](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords)

  Splits a shard into two new shards in the stream, to increase the stream's
  capacity to ingest and transport data. `SplitShard` is called when there is
  a need to increase the overall capacity of stream because of an expected
  increase in the volume of data records being ingested.

  You can also use `SplitShard` when a shard appears to be approaching its
  maximum utilization, for example, when the set of producers sending data
  into the specific shard are suddenly sending more than previously
  anticipated. You can also call `SplitShard` to increase stream capacity, so
  that more Amazon Kinesis applications can simultaneously read data from the
  stream for real-time processing.

  You must specify the shard to be split and the new hash key, which is the
  position in the shard where the shard gets split in two. In many cases, the
  new hash key might simply be the average of the beginning and ending hash
  key, but it can be any hash key value in the range being mapped into the
  shard. For more information about splitting shards, see [Split a
  Shard](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-resharding-split.html)
